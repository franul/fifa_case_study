# Fifa19 case study

Analyis of Kaggle Fifa 19 player dataset [[1](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19)] made for final grade for my machine learning course.
Jupyter notebook contains code used for analysis. I use mainly numpy, pandas, matplotlib for data visualization and sklearn libraries for models.
In scratch, I performed:
- basic statistical analysis
- data discretization
- correlation analysis
- feature selection
- PCA

Then:
- I leanrt few models and tested their performances
- I selceted the most promising models and hypertuned their parameters

I have recieved 83,2% accuracy on test set (20% of whole data set) for Decision Tree Classifier for discretizied, standarized data.
